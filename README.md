## I am Linus Karlsson, an M.Sc Student in Media Technology and Engineering.

Welcome to my page! I love to work with creative solutions and to fully immerse myself in an exciting project. I am an ambitious and independent worker, but work at my absolute best ability in an engaged team. I know how to communicate and I have a positive attitude. Right now I am doing my master studies in media technology and engineering at LinkÃ¶ping University.

## Projects

An overview of projects, including projects that are currently in private repositories can be found on my [portfolio page](https://linnet5.github.io/).
