## I am Linus Karlsson, another game devloper.

Welcome to my page! I love to work with creative solutions and to fully immerse myself in an exciting project. I am an ambitious and independent worker, but work at my absolute best ability in an engaged team. Did my master studies in media technology and engineering at LinkÃ¶ping University.

## Projects

An overview of my projects, including stuff that isn't public on github can be found on my [portfolio page](https://linnet5.github.io/).
